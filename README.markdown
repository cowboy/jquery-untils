# jQuery Untils: nextUntil, prevUntil, parentsUntil #
[http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-untils-plugin/](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-untils-plugin/)

Version: v1.0, Last updated: 12/1/2009

jQuery Untils provides three very simple, but very useful methods: nextUntil, prevUntil, and parentsUntil. These methods are based on their nextAll, prevAll, and parents counterparts, except that they allow you to stop when a certain selector is reached. Elements are returned in "traversal order".

Note that these methods take a less na√Øve approach than others bearing the same names, and are designed to actually return elements in traversal order, despite the element ordering flaws inherent in the jQuery 1.3.2 selector engine. A [ticket](http://dev.jquery.com/ticket/5551) and [patch](http://github.com/cowboy/jquery/commit/cbf1da9ed88b14bc991fc2dcfec87750d19237ad) have been submitted to the jQuery team for hopeful inclusion in the 1.4 release.
