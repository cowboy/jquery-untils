# jQuery Untils: nextUntil, prevUntil, parentsUntil #
[http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-untils-plugin/](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-untils-plugin/)

Version: v1.1, Last updated: 2/18/2010

jQuery Untils provides three very simple, but very useful methods: nextUntil, prevUntil, and parentsUntil. These methods are based on their nextAll, prevAll, and parents counterparts, except that they allow you to stop when a certain selector is reached. Elements are returned in "traversal order".

**As of jQuery 1.4, these methods are now included in jQuery core! See the <a href="http://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/2b481b93cfca62f95aa7005e7db651456fa08e65">patch</a> as well as the official documentation on the
<a href="http://api.jquery.com/prevUntil/">.prevUntil</a>, 
<a href="http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/">.nextUntil</a> and
<a href="http://api.jquery.com/parentsUntil/">.parentsUntil</a> methods.**

Note that these methods take a less na√Øve approach than others bearing the same names, and are designed to actually return elements in traversal order, despite the element ordering flaws inherent in the jQuery 1.3.2 selector engine.
